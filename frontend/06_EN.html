		<p><b>Trail 6 - Il Lago Scaffaiolo</b><br />Glimpses of Lake Scaffaiolo<br>
Short and not very demanding excursion both technically and in terms of height difference (to make it even easier it is possible to reach the Croce Arcana by car instead of starting from the Doganaccia). Scaffaiolo Lake is a place around which a magical atmosphere is created. Glimpses of light, sunsets and panoramas as far as the eye can see can suddenly emerge from the thick fog that sometimes envelops this stretch of ridge. The Duca degli Abruzzi refuge - which is located next to the lake - can be used as a stopping point for other excursions along the ridges or to the nearby Dardagna waterfalls.</a></p>

	  <b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b><br>
<b>Doganaccia</b> Ancient border customs between the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Duchy of Modena. The village is one of the most suggestive winter resorts in the Pistoia mountains and in the summer a valid starting point for the many hikers and amateur cyclists (mountain bikes).</br>

<b>Lake Scaffaiolo (1775 meters)</b>
Since ancient times the origin of the scaffaiolo lake has been the subject of heated discussions which were based on various hypotheses, some of which were truly bizarre, from the volcanic one to underground channels that fed the lake directly from the sea. Scaffaiolo seems to derive from "Scaffa" and that is "conca" and this is perhaps the origin. The impermeable rocks that characterize this part of
Apennines retain the water collected from the small reservoir. Formed by Monte Cupolino.
The absence of any vegetable form due to the high altitude has prevented it from silting up over time. In fact, the measurements of the lake have remained the same at least since 1665, the year in which some depth measurements were made.
